# Lab Activities
A repository for all the source codes and figures for the laboratory activities conducted during DLSU NSCOM03 course (T1 2024-2025).

## Structure
Each laboratory activity is separated into its own folder. Each folder has two subdirectories called `figures`, where you can find the generated Python figures used for the laboratory activity, and `src`, where you can find the Python source codes used to generate the figures.
